# Pokémon Sprites

A repo hosting the sprites from Pokémon Sun & Moon / Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon.

The sprites were downloaded from serebii.net using a script I wrote in JavaScript. The code it's quite ugly because I'm still figuring out how to organize it since I'm planning to add support for downloading the sprites from past games.
